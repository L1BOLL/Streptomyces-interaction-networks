# Streptomyces-interaction-networks
Minimal PyTorch Geometric notebook that turns a 60Ã—60 bacterial-interaction adjacency matrix into a graph auto-encoder. Trains a 2-layer GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) encoder, learns node embeddings, clusters with k-means, plots latent space. Drop in any square CSV (Comma-Separated Values), run, adapt, reuse.
